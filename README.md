# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the critical phase of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 

It serves as a learning and documentation resource covering key concepts such as requirement gathering, elicitation, modeling, validation, and prioritization. The purpose is to provide a structured approach to understanding how software requirements are identified, refined, and confirmed to guide successful project delivery.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders' needs, expectations, and constraints are gathered, analyzed, and clearly defined to guide the design and development of a software solution.

During this phase, business analysts, system architects, and developers collaborate with clients and end-users to understand the problem the software aims to solve. The goal is to identify both **functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform).

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:

- üîç **Clarity and Understanding**: It ensures a shared understanding between stakeholders and developers, minimizing misinterpretations.
- üéØ **Project Scope Definition**: Clearly defined requirements help establish the boundaries of the project, preventing scope creep.
- üí∏ **Cost and Time Efficiency**: Early detection and clarification of requirements reduce costly rework and project delays.
- ‚úÖ **Validation and Quality**: Well-documented and validated requirements provide a solid foundation for testing, ensuring the software meets user needs.

Requirement Analysis lays the groundwork for successful project execution, helping teams build the right product ‚Äî not just build the product right.
